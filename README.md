# Poker

This is a simple program that compares poker hands. For funsies, most of the code uses raw integers to store cards,
and evaluate hands.

To build:
```shell script
./gradlew jar
```

This produced a compressed distribution inside `build/distributions`.
You can run the `Poker` script inside its `bin/` folder.
